Data visualisation
What is it and who uses it?
From maps to royal family trees, data visualisation has a long history in presenting, understanding and maximising value from data. Today, when the amount of data being generated is growing exponentially, there is a greater need than ever for people and tools to apply data visualisation skills to make sense of it. The range of types of data is also expanding with video, sound, sensor data, network data, web statistics and communications data.
Data visualisation techniques may differ greatly depending on the context and the intended audience. In data science, it may be used as part of data exploration, and as an aid in statistical analysis. In media, it is used to demonstate concepts or figures, or help tell a story. In business it is used to do all of these.
Some common types of visual used include line and bar charts, scatter plots and histograms. Other more specialised charts and graphs include those used for networks, economic data like stock prices, Gantt charts for project planning.
